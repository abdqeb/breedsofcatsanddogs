# API for Final Project for AI course at McMaster University

I copied this repo so I can deploy my 37 breeds of cats and dogs classifier. This starter should allow me to test snapping pictures of animals with my phone and testing them against my model.

The original sample app can be found here https://fastai-v3.onrender.com. It checks between Black/Brown/Teddy bears.

The guide for production deployment to Render is at https://course.fast.ai/deployment_render.html.
