* My file is actually .pkl and not .pth, will have to see if I need to make other changes related to this
* The idea is that the pkl will be hosted in onedrive, google, dropbox to save on space here. My model is about 105MB. 
* Don't put your models inside this folder beforehand as these files can be large in size, and we want to keep our cloud deployment as light as possible and ask the app to download whatever file it needs.
